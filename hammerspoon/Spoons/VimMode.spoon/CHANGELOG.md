# 2021-02-13

* Added a function for running an accessibility test suite against any field: `hs.hotkey.bind(mods, key, VimMode.utils.debug.testAccessibilityField)`
  * Will add more tests to this suite as we need to debug more problems down the line-ideally people can just run this function when reporting a bug.

# 2020-12-28

* Added a beta feature for enforcing fallback mode on certain URL patterns in Chrome and Safari (see README)
* Made hitting `escape` when tapping `g` cancel and reset to normal mode [closes #56]

# 2020-11-30

* Rollback the keypress disallowing - it conflicts with the keys we send in fallback mode.

# 2020-11-29

* Added the `iw` "in word" text object motion
* Added the `i[`, `i<`, `i{`, `i'`, `i"`, and `i`` motions.

* Update the modal to disallow pressing keys that aren't registered with the current active mode

# 2020-11-04

* Fix offset calculations with UTF-8 characters like smart quotes.

# 2020-10-15
